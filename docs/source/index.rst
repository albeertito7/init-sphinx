Welcome to Lumache's documentation!
===================================

**Lumache** (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers that
creates recipes mixing random ingredients.  It pulls data from the `Open Food
Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_ and offers a *simple* and
*intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including how to :ref:`install <installation>` the project.

..
   the "install" refers to the text link, and
   the "<installation>" part refers to the actual label we want to add a cross-reference to.
   if not included an explicit title, hence using ":ref:`installation`, the sectio title will be used.
   Both the ":doc:" and ":ref:" roles will be rendered as hyperlinks in HTML documentation.

.. note::
   This project is under active development.

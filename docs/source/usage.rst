Installation
------------

To use Lumache, first install it using pip:

.. code-block:: console

   (.venv) $ pip install lumache

..
    This new file contains two section headers, normal paragraph text, 
    and a code-block directive that renders a block of content as source code, 
    with appropriate syntax highlighting (in this case, generic console text).

..
    The structure of the document is determined by the succession of heading styles, 
    which means that,  by using --- for the “Installation” section after === for the “Usage” section, 
    you have declared “Installation” to be a subsection of “Usage”.
